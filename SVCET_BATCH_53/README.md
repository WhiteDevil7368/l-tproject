Project Title: Garbage Bin Level Prediction and Collection

Aim:  To develop machine learning models to predict the filled status of garbage bins based on various features such as date, time, bin level, Bin ID, week number, fill level (in liters), total liters, fill percentage, location, latitude, longitude, temperature (in ‚Å∞C), and battery level.

Result: The results of developing ML models for garbage bin level prediction are evaluated using judging metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the models in correctly classifying filled and unfilled bins, enabling assessment of their effectiveness in waste management applications.
